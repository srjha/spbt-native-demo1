## Spring Native

This project has been configured to let you generate a lightweight container running a native executable.
Docker should be installed and configured on your machine prior to creating the image, see [the Getting Started section of the reference guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/0.9.1/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-buildpacks).

To create the image, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image
```

Then, you can run the app like any other container:

```
$ docker run --rm spbt-native-demo1:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```
